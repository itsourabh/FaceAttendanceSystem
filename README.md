ðŸ“Œ Face Attendance System
This project is an AI-powered attendance system that uses face recognition technology to automatically mark attendance. It eliminates the need for manual attendance systems and provides a faster, contactless, and accurate solution.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and dlib/face_recognition library
âœ… Stores attendance data in CSV/Database with date and time
âœ… Marks attendance automatically when a registered face is detected
âœ… Prevents duplicate entries by verifying time intervals
âœ… User-friendly interface for adding/removing student faces

ðŸ›  Tech Stack Used:
Python â€“ Core programming language

OpenCV â€“ For image processing and face detection

face_recognition â€“ For facial feature extraction and recognition

Pandas â€“ For data storage and processing

Tkinter (optional) â€“ For GUI-based interaction

ðŸš€ Outcome:
ðŸ”¹ Reduced manual attendance time by 70%
ðŸ”¹ Ensured accuracy above 90% in detecting registered faces
ðŸ”¹ Can be integrated into schools, colleges, and companies for automation
